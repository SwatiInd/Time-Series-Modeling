# Time-Series-Modeling

Welcome to time series modeling repository. According to [Neptun.ap](https://neptune.ai/blog/select-model-for-time-series-prediction-task), methods of predictions can be classified into following four categories:

1. Classical time series models:

They use temporal variation in the series. Traditionally, they are used for univariate time series but some of them can be extended for external variables. In [](), ARIMA family models are studied.

2. Supervised models:

Machine learning supervised models (e.g.: linear regression, random forest etc.) can be used for time series if seasonality can be put into a variable. Also, the autocorrelation effects can also be added in input variables. Methods for identifying strong time parameters and lags have been developed earlier [Target Variable - Feature Engineering](https://github.com/SwatiInd/Time-Series-Analysis/blob/main/TargetVariableProcessing.py) and would be extensively used in developing models.

3. Deep learning models:

Supervised models are good in forecasting of time series data but they require intense feature engineering. Deep learning methods (CNN, RNN, and LSTM) are useful in time series forecasting.

4. Advanced and specific models:
